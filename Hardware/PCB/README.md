### Design files for a manufacturable Printed Circuit Board
Single-board design files (KiCad): `Residential_PCB_Design-SMD`.

SamacSys footprints/symvols (KiCad): `SamacSys_PCB_Library/KiCad`.

Files for manufacture: `Manufacturer_Files`.

### Dependancies
Depends on Sparkfun KiCad Libraries and SamacSys footprints and symbols.

SamacSys footprints and symbols included in the repository. For instructions to install Sparkfun KiCad libraries in KiCad 5:
