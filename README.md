# CIWS-MWM-Logger

This repository contains hardware and software designs for a datalogger that can be used to collect high resolution water use data on magnetically-driven residential water meters. The datalogger is designed to read magnetic field information from a magnetometer sensor attached to a magnetically-driven positive-displacement water meter. The data is then processed into magnetic pulses per time period, configurable by the user. This data is stored on an SD Card, and can be read from a personal computer. Configuration is done over a serial interface.

Documentation: The Docs folder contains documentation pertaining to this datalogger.

Firmware: The Firmware folder contains code written for the datalogger.

Hardware: The Hardware folder contains hardware design information for off-the-shelf components as well as a 
manufacturable PCB.

Tools: The Tools folder contains software tools for characterizing the magnetic signal on residential water 
meters.

## Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply (CIWS) 

CIWS is a project funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation to develop cyberinfrastructure for smart water metering and high resolution water-use data collection. We are developing systems for high resolution residential water consumption data collection, processing and analysis.
