# CIWS-MWM-Logger

This repository contains hardware and software designs for a datalogger that can be used to collect high resolution water use data on magnetically-driven residential water meters. The datalogger is designed to read magnetic field information from a magnetometer sensor attached to a magnetically-driven positive-displacement water meter. The data is then processed into magnetic pulses per 4-second period. This data is stored on an SD Card, and can be read from a personal computer. Configuration is done over a serial interface.

It is recommended that the magnetic signal from a water meter be characterized prior to use of the datalogger to ensure the success of the device. A simple setup to accomplish this characterization will be included in this repository soon.

## Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply (CIWS) 

CIWS is a project funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation to develop cyberinfrastructure for smart water metering and high resolution water-use data collection. We are developing systems for high resolution residential water consumption data collection, processing and analysis.
