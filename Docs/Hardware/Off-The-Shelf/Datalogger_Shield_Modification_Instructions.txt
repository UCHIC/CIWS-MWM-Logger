Steps to adapt the Adafruit Datalogger Shield (Rev. C) to a 3.3 V Arduino Pro:

	1. Solder Header Pins

	2. Short SCL and SDA jumpers on bottom to connect SCL and SDA to A5 and A4, respectively.
		This is done because the 3.3 V Arduino Pro does not have seperate SCL and SDA pins like a normal Uno.

	3. Short the IOr, 3V, and 5V pads. This connects the I2C pullup resistors to 3.3 V.
		Because the Arduino Pro runs on 3.3 V, the "5V" pad is really at 3.3 V. Note that the datalogger shield does not
		connect with the Arduino Uno 3.3 V output, as it is designed to generate its own.

	4. Remove the 3.3 V Regulator. The system is already supplied with 3.3 V.

	5. Remove the Power LED -- This helps extend battery life.

	6. Mark the shield to note that it has been modified for the 3.3 V Arduino Pro.
